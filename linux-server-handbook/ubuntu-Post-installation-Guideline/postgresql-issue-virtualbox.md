## Postgresql Version Issue in VirtualBox

1. Update Package Lists: Update your package lists to ensure you get the latest versions available.

```
sudo apt update
```

2. Install PostgreSQL 16 Packages: Install the latest PostgreSQL 16 server and client packages.
```
sudo apt install postgresql-16 postgresql-client-16
```
3. Stop PostgreSQL Service: Stop the PostgreSQL service to perform the upgrade.
```
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```
4. Upgrade Existing Clusters: Use pg_upgradecluster utility to upgrade the existing clusters to the new PostgreSQL 16 version. You need to run this command for each cluster you have.
```
sudo pg_upgradecluster 15 main
```
Replace main with the name of your cluster if it's different.

5. Restart PostgreSQL Service: After upgrading the clusters, restart the PostgreSQL service.
```
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```
6. Verify Upgrade: Verify that the upgrade was successful and that PostgreSQL 16 is running properly.
```
sudo pg_lsclusters
```
7. Cleanup (Optional): Once you're confident that the upgrade was successful and there are no issues, you can remove the obsolete PostgreSQL 15 packages if you don't need them anymore.
```
sudo apt purge postgresql-15
```
8. Verify Version: Finally, verify that PostgreSQL 16 is the active version.
```
psql --version
```
9. configuring postgresql 16
```
dpkg --configure -a
```
