##  Discovering Live Hosts 


### TryHackMe Note


Let’s revisit the TCP/IP layers shown in the figure next. We will leverage the protocols to discover the live hosts. Starting from bottom to top, we can use:

ARP from Link Layer
ICMP from Network Layer
TCP from Transport Layer
UDP from Transport Layer

Before we discuss how scanners can use each in detail, we will briefly review these four protocols. ARP has one purpose: sending a frame to the broadcast address on the network segment and asking the computer with a specific IP address to respond by providing its MAC (hardware) address.

[ICMP]([Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Parameters (iana.org)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml)) has many types. ICMP ping uses Type 8 (Echo) and Type 0 (Echo Reply).

If you want to ping a system on the same subnet, an ARP query should precede the ICMP Echo.

Although TCP and UDP are transport layers, for network scanning purposes, a scanner can send a specially-crafted packet to common TCP or UDP ports to check whether the target will respond. This method is efficient, especially when ICMP Echo is blocked.
