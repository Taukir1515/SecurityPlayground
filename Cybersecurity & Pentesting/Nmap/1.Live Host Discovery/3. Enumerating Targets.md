We mentioned the different techniques we can use for scanning in Task 1. Before we explain each in detail and put it into use against a live target, we need to specify the targets we want to scan. Generally speaking, you can provide a list, a range, or a subnet. Examples of target specification are:

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">list</mark>: MACHINE_IP scanme.nmap.org example.com will scan 3 IP addresses.
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">range</mark>: 10.11.12.15-20 will scan 6 IP addresses: 10.11.12.15, 10.11.12.16,… and 10.11.12.20.
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">subnet</mark>: MACHINE_IP/30 will scan 4 IP addresses.

You can also provide a file as input for your list of targets, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">nmap -iL list_of_hosts.txt</mark>.

If you want to check the list of hosts that Nmap will scan, you can use nmap -sL TARGETS. This option will give you a detailed list of the hosts that Nmap will scan without scanning them; however, Nmap will attempt a reverse-DNS resolution on all the targets to obtain their names. Names might reveal various information to the pentester. (If you don’t want Nmap to the DNS server, you can add -n.)

Launch the AttackBox using the Start AttackBox button, open the terminal when the AttackBox is ready, and use Nmap to answer the following.

## Answer the questions below

- What is the first IP address Nmap would scan if you provided 10.10.12.13/29 as your target?
> 10.10.12.8

- How many IP addresses will Nmap scan if you provide the following range 10.10.0-255.101-125? 
> 6400
