##  Nmap Host Discovery Using ARP 


### Commands & Instructions

	--ARP scan
		nmap -PR -sn Machine_IP/24

### TryHackMe Note

How would you know which hosts are up and running? It is essential to avoid wasting our time port-scanning an offline host or an IP address not in use. There are various ways to discover online hosts. When no host discovery options are provided, Nmap follows the following approaches to discover live hosts:

1. When a privileged user tries to scan targets on a local network (Ethernet), Nmap uses ARP requests. A privileged user is root or a user who belongs to sudoers and can run sudo.
2. When a privileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap uses ICMP echo requests, TCP ACK (Acknowledge) to port 80, TCP SYN (Synchronize) to port 443, and ICMP timestamp request.
3. When an unprivileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap resorts to a TCP 3-way handshake by sending SYN packets to ports 80 and 443.

Nmap, by default, uses a ping scan to find live hosts</mark>, then proceeds to scan live hosts only. If you want to use Nmap to discover online hosts without port-scanning the live systems, you can issue `nmap -sn TARGETS`. Let’s dig deeper to gain a solid understanding of the different techniques used.

ARP scan is possible only if you are on the same subnet as the target systems. On an Ethernet (802.3) and WiFi (802.11), you need to know the MAC address of any system before you can communicate with it. The MAC address is necessary for the link-layer header; the header contains the source MAC address and the destination MAC address among other fields. To get the MAC address, the OS sends an ARP query. A host that replies to ARP queries is up. The ARP query only works if the target is on the same subnet as yourself, i.e., on the same Ethernet/WiFi. You should expect to see many ARP queries generated during a Nmap scan of a local network. If you want Nmap only to perform an ARP scan without port-scanning, you can use `nmap -PR -sn TARGETS`, where <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">`-PR` indicates that you only want an ARP scan.</mark> The following example shows Nmap using ARP for host discovery without any port scanning. We run <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">`nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24`</mark> to discover all the live systems on the same subnet as our target machine.

In this case, the AttackBox had the IP address 10.10.210.6, and it used ARP requests to discover the live hosts on the same subnet. ARP scan works, as shown in the figure below. Nmap sends ARP requests to all the target computers, and those online should send an ARP reply back.

If we look at the packets generated using a tool such as tcpdump or Wireshark, we will see network traffic similar to the figure below. In the figure below, Wireshark displays the source MAC address, destination MAC address, protocol, and query related to each ARP request. The source address is the MAC address of our AttackBox, while the destination is the broadcast address as we don’t know the MAC address of the target. However, we see the target’s IP address, which appears in the Info column. In the figure, we can see that we are requesting the MAC addresses of all the IP addresses on the subnet, starting with 10.10.210.1. The host with the IP address we are asking about will send an ARP reply with its MAC address, and that’s how we will know that it is online.

Talking about ARP scans, we should mention a scanner built around ARP queries: arp-scan; it provides many options to customize your scan. Visit the arp-scan wiki for detailed information. One popular choice is `arp-scan --localnet` or simply `arp-scan -l`. This command will send ARP queries to all valid IP addresses on your local networks. Moreover, if your system has more than one interface and you are interested in discovering the live hosts on one of them, you can specify the interface using -I. For instance, sudo arp-scan -I eth0 -l will send ARP queries for all valid IP addresses on the eth0 interface.

Note that arp-scan is not installed on the AttackBox; however, it can be installed using apt install arp-scan.

In the example below, we scanned the subnet of the AttackBox using arp-scan ATTACKBOX_IP/24. Since we ran this scan at a time frame close to the previous one `nmap -PR -sn ATTACKBOX_IP/24`, we obtained the same three live targets.

Similarly, the command arp-scan will generate many ARP queries that we can see using tcpdump, Wireshark, or a similar tool. We can notice that the packet capture for arp-scan and nmap -PR -sn yield similar traffic patterns. Below is the Wireshark output.

## Answer the questions below

- We will be sending broadcast ARP Requests packets with the following options:

From computer1
To computer1 (to indicate it is broadcast)
Packet Type: “ARP Request”
Data: try all the possible eight devices (other than computer1) in the network: computer2, computer3, computer4, computer5, computer6, switch1, switch2, and router.

- How many devices are you able to discover using ARP requests?
> 3
