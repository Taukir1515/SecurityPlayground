## Introduction

This room is the second in the Nmap series (part of the Introduction to Network Security module).

1. Nmap Live Host Discovery
2. Nmap Basic Port Scans
3. Nmap Advanced Port Scans
4. Nmap Post Port Scans

In the previous room, we focused on discovering online systems. So far, we have covered three steps of a Nmap scan: 

1. Enumerate targets
2. Discover live hosts
3. Reverse-DNS lookup

The next step would be checking which ports are open and listening and which ports are closed. Therefore, in this room and the next one, we focus on port scanning and the different types of port scans used by nmap. This room explains:

1. TCP connect port scan
2. TCP SYN port scan
3. UDP port scan

Moreover, we discuss the different options to specify the ports, the scan rate, and the number of parallel probes.
