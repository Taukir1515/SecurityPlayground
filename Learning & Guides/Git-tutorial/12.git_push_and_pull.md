# git push and pull

## Push to remote repo
`git push`  
`git push -u remote_repo_name branch_name`  
    - `git push -u origin master`

## pull from remote repo
`git pull`  
`git pull remote_repo_name branch_name`  
    - `git pull origin master`


### Tips:
---
1. If any changes occur in the pushed GitHub repo, we can't push the remote repo to the GitHub repo for the second time.
2. We need to pull the GitHub repo back to the local repo, and then push it back to GitHub.
```
git pull origin master
```
```
git push
