# Module: Resolving Git Push Issues with Unrelated Histories and Permissions
## Problem Description

1. Permission Denied (403):

- The user encountered a 403 error when attempting to push to the remote repository. This was caused by mismatched credentials (e.g., Taukir1515 vs pentest-taukir).

2. Unrelated Histories:

- The local repository and the remote repository had unrelated commit histories, leading to the error: fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories.

3. Branch Tracking:

- The local main branch was not set to track the remote main branch, causing issues with git pull and git push.


## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Fix Permission Issues

Verify GitHub Account:

Ensure the correct GitHub account is being used:

```bash
git config --global user.name "pentesttaukir"
git config --global user.email "pentesttaukir@gmail.com"
```

Clear Cached Credentials:

- On Windows, clear credentials via the Windows Credential Manager:
	- Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager > Windows Credentials.
	- Remove any entries related to github.com.

Re-authenticate:

- Push again, and when prompted, use:
	- Username: pentest-taukir
	- Password: A Personal Access Token (PAT) generated from GitHub.

### Step 2: Resolve Unrelated Histories

Pull Remote Changes with --allow-unrelated-histories:

	- Merge the local and remote repositories:

```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any):

Open conflicting files, resolve conflicts, and stage the changes:

```
git add <file-with-conflict>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```


### Step 3: Push Changes
Push the Local Branch to Remote:

Push the changes to the remote repository:

```
git push -u origin main
```

Set Upstream Branch (if needed):

Link the local main branch to the remote main branch:

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
```
