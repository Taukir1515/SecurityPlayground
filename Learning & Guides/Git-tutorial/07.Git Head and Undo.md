# Git Head and Undo

> `git checkout`  
> `git show`

> [!Tip]
> "git checkout" is safe to operate rather than 'git reset'

## To see details in a Commit
`git show Commit_ID`

## To undo/discard a modified file content
`git checkout modified_file_name`

## To move any of the commits
`git checkout commit_ID`

- If we move to a previous commit, the recent commits will be hidden temporarily.

## To restore all commits
`git checkout master`

> [!Important]  
> Even if we modify and commit a file after 'git checkout', it won't be saved.

> After giving "git checkout master" command, all the commits will be restored, and the modified commit will be erased.
